# Advent of Code 2022

I solved these in Elixir with [Livebook](https://livebook.dev/) which is like
Jupyter notebooks for Elixir. It's a nice easy way to try out Elixir as you can
run it on [fly.io's free tier](https://fly.io/launch/livebook). One thing to be
careful of when using Livebook is the code outside of Modules is interpreted and
runs slower. So if your solution is running too slow then move most of the work
into a Module.

I used this advent of code to learn some Elixir, so my solutions aren't
necessarily idiomatic, though I think I solved some problems elegantly and some
kind of messy. After solving a problem I like to look over everyone else's
solutions in the same language and often learn about some useful functions in
the standard library or more idiomatic ways of expressing things, maybe others
will like to look over mine.
